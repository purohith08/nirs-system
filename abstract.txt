ABSTRACT 
Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of mortality among women 
globally, highlighting the urgent need for accessible and non-invasive screening 
technologies. While mammography is the clinical standard, its limitations—such 
as radiation exposure, discomfort, and reduced effectiveness in dense breast 
tissue—necessitate alternative approaches. This project proposes a cost
effective, portable imaging system based on Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) 
and Diffuse Optical Tomography (DOT) for early breast cancer detection. 
Utilizing affordable components like the ESP32 microcontroller and BPW34 
photodiodes, the prototype simulates breast tissue scanning through a phantom 
model. The system captures near-infrared light interactions with tissue, 
processes the data using Arduino, and visualizes it through MATLAB-generated 
heatmaps. These heatmaps highlight areas of increased absorption, potentially 
indicating tumor presence. Performance analysis demonstrates high reliability 
and user-friendliness, with strong potential for adaptation into wearable or 
home-based screening tools. By bridging the gap between advanced diagnostics 
and low-resource environments, this system aims to democratize early breast 
cancer detection and improve health outcomes.
